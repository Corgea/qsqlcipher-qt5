# qsqlcipher plugin ( for Qt5 )

Builds only on Qt 5.8.0 for now.

You will need the SQLCipher headers and libraries installed before
compiling this plugin.

The qsqlcipher.pro and smain.cpp are based on files from qsqlite
 qtbase/src/plugins/sqldrivers/sqlite
The qsql_sqlite.cpp and qsql_sqlite_p.h were copied without
modifications from the same source.
